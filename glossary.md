# Glossary

Throughout my JavaScript learning journey, I've found several terms to be confusing and not explained well to a code newbie. This definition list is meant to spare you the same agony.

arity: the number of variables passed into a function

callback: a function inside another function

currying: 

DOT: Do One Thing (best practice for writing a function)

DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself (restrict duplicate code)

event listener: waiting for a something (an event) to happen, often used to wait for a user to do something

function:

IIFE: Immediately Invoked Functional Expressions; an anonymous function that wraps all the code to create its own scope

iteration: 

lambda: a function used as a data in an argument or a return value

method: a function within an object

polymorphic function: function that does something different every time different parameters are passed in

promise:

pure function: a function that outputs the same result each time (opposite of polymorphic)
