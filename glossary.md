# Glossary

Throughout my JavaScript learning journey, I've found several terms to be confusing and not explained well to a code newbie. This definition list is meant to spare you the same agony.

arity: the number of variables passed into a function

callback: a function used as a parameter of another function; called after the other function has done its job

currying: 

DOT: Do One Thing (best practice for writing a function)

DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself (restrict duplicate code)

event listener: waiting for a something (an event) to happen, often used to wait for a user to do something

function:

IIFE: Immediately Invoked Functional Expressions; an anonymous function that wraps all the code to create its own scope

iteration: 

lambda: a function used as data in an argument or a return value

method: a function within an object

object: technically EVERYTHING in JavaScript is an object, but this term is often used for a collection of key and value pairs

polymorphic function: function that does something different every time different parameters are passed in

promise: an object that allows you to call a callback function to success to failure queues (ES6)

pure function: a function that outputs the same result each time (opposite of polymorphic)
