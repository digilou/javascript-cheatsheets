# JavaScript Syntax Quick Reference for the DOM

This code list compliation is a result of my attempt to master the syntax of JavaScript. There are plenty of tutorials, documentation, and resources out there about JavaScript. The intention of thir repository is a quick reference or cheatsheet of basic to intermediate syntax.

Cheatsheet lists include:
- [Getting elements](getting-elements.js)
- [Getting node values](getting-node-values.js)
- [Node lists](node-lists.js)
- [Setting attributes](setting-attributes.js)
